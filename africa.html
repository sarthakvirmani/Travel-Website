there. As you plan your next African journey, be sure to include at least one from this list of best places to visit in
 Africa as your schedule will allow.</p>

<p align="center">Sossusvlei means "the gathering place of water" but you'll need to bring your own if you don't want to dehydrate at this, Namibia's most outstanding attraction.
</p>
<p align ="center">The dunes have developed over millions of years, the result of material flowing from the Orange River into the Atlantic, carried north and returned again to land by the surf.
Climbing the dunes yields breathtaking views, including the Deadvlei, a ghostly expanse of dried white clay punctuated by skeletons of ancient camelthorn trees.

<p align="center">One of the world's most majestic water spectacles, Victoria Falls (also called Mosi-oa-Tunya, or "The Cloud That Thunders) -- were reportedly first seen by a European when Scotsman David Livingstone journeyed here in 1855.</p>

<p align="center">Since then thousands have enjoyed the spray from the 108-meter high cascade, which was once recorded flowing at 12,800 cubic meters per second -- double that of Niagara's highest flow.

<br>The most famous of the structures at Giza, near Cairo, the Pyramid of King Cheops was built around 2650 BC from 2.5 million blocks of limestone.
Its sides are oriented exactly to the north, south, east and west.</p>
 
<p align ="center">The Chephren pyramid, built by Cheops' son, is similar in size and incorporates the entrances to a burial chamber which still contains the large granite sarcophagus of King Chephren.
The pyramid of Mycerinus is smaller than both and all three are surrounded by other smaller pyramids and dozens of tombs.</p>

<p align="center">Just off the coast of Mozambique, and in the waters of the Indian Ocean, is the island of Madagascar. While the island nation has a lot to do, see and explore, a highlight is undoubtedly the Isalo National Park. Within the park, you will have access to a wide range of terrain types. Be prepared to spot enormous canyons, lush palm-tree oases and even unique sandstone formations. The best way to see Isalo National Park is on a guided trek, and many people opt for overnight camping to enhance the once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>

<p align ="center">In the far north of Tanzania, close to the Kenyan border, is the famed Mount Kilimanjaro. The peak is the tallest in Africa, and the tallest free-standing mountain in the world, making it a bucket-list destination for many travelers. While the very fit can trek to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, there are also other ways to explore the area. There are several shorter, easier hikes around the base of the mountain along with some gorgeous waterfalls and plenty of amazing scenery.

The island is dotted with a few luxury resorts, but the two main attractions on the island are Anse Lazio and the Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve. Anse Lazio is a gorgeous beach with clear water and amazing opportunities for snorkeling. The Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve is a palm forest that is preserved and serves as the home to countless reptiles and birds, including the very rare Seychelles Black Parrot. </p>
