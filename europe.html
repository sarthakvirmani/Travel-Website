<br>
<br>
<p align="center">Once a busy seaport in the estuary of the Loire, the fascinating city of Nantes was chosen in
 the old times by the dukes of Brittany as their historical capital. If the city still boasts a
 unique architectural heritage with its magnificent Ch�teau des ducs de Bretagne, a Renaissance-style castle nestled in a fortress, a
 medieval quarter and one of the highest cathedrals of France -  it has been transformed in the last 20 years
 probably more than any other city in France.
</p>
<p align ="center">It is not only a vibrant and young metropolis often rewarded for its top-quality of life - Nantes
 was also Green Capital of Europe in 2013 � but a city where art has literally been integrated
 in all possible aspects, making it a true example of how artists can turn a city upside down!

 Flores. Brought together in an archipelago, each Azorean island has its own identity. Even if
 they all share an extraordinary natural legacy, they also have their own unique strokes in
 their landscape, traditions, cuisine and architecture.</p>
