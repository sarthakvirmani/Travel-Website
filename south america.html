<h1><font color="grey" size="10" ><center> BEST PLACES TO VISIT IN SOUTH AMERICA</center></h1></font>
<p align="center">
South America, that vast territory of huge peaks, impenetrable jungles and old civilizations, is the perfect destination for any adventure traveler.</p>

<p align="center">The Latin-flavored continent has virtually everything you could expect: vibrant cities, colonial towns, smoky volcanoes, impressive lakes, deep traditions and, above all, some of the friendliest people on earth.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p align="center"><font size="14" <font face="verdana" color="grey">1.Angel Falls</font></p>

<br>
<p align="center"> Salto Angel, also known as Kerepakupai (the deepest fall) to the Pem�n tribe, is one of the most breathtaking places I�ve seen in my life.

It�s located in Canaima National Park and, at 979 meters high, is the highest uninterrupted waterfall in the world.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://www.travelsauro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/uyuni-laguna-colorada.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p align="center"Sticking with the �records� theme, Salar de Uyuni is the world�s largest salt flat, at over 10,000 square kilometers.!</p>
</p>

<p align="center">Region�s endless white expanses and surreal scenery. It really looked liked a planet in which smoky volcanoes, colored lagoons and great deserts create the scenery.</p>

<br>
<p align="center">Salvador da Bahia, also known as just Salvador, has several things going for it. The Portuguese founded it in 1548, so it�s one of the oldest colonial cities in the Americas. You�ll see its rich past in Pelourinho, the historic center named for the whipping post where slaves were beaten. Brazil�s third largest city was also the first slave port in the Americas; traces of this African heritage can be found in the local culture today, especially the cuisine. Salvador also is a party town, hosting the world�s largest party: its annual Carnival celebration.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="http://cdn.touropia.com/gfx/b/2016/03/ushuaia.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p align="center">If you like to visit remote places, then put Ushuaia on your bucket list. The capital of Argentina�s Tierra del Fuego, Ushuaia is considered the southernmost city in the world. Indeed, the train to the End of the World ends here. Nestled among the mountains along a bay, Ushuaia is very picturesque when it�s not cloudy or windy, which is much of the time. The former penal colony has a museum and it�s a good place to see penguins, orca whales and seals.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="http://cdn.touropia.com/gfx/b/2016/06/Quito.jpg"></p>
<br>Ecuador�s capital, Quito, is unique among world capitals. It is the highest capital in the world (La Paz is higher but isn�t Bolivia�s legal capital) and also closest to the equator. Founded by the Spanish in 1534, Quito�s colorful old town is one of the best-preserved, least changed and largest in all the Americas. Located in Ecuador�s northern highlands, the city is surrounded by volcanoes that can be seen on a clear day. Quito is the only world capital that is threatened by active volcanoes.

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="http://cdn.touropia.com/gfx/b/2016/03/buenos_aires.jpg">
<br>
<p align="center">With 17 million people, Buenos Aires has the fourth largest population in the Americas. Located on the Rio de la Plata on the Argentinian coast, the city is noted for its cosmopolitan flair. Because of its architecture and rich cultural life, Buenos Aires is the most visited city in South America. A must-see here is the Recoleta, a residential neighborhood known for its history. The Recoleta Cemetery is the district�s most famous attraction; it�s where Eva Peron is buried.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="http://cdn.touropia.com/gfx/b/2016/03/iguazu_falls.jpg">
<br>
<p align="center">One of the best places to visit in South America, Iguazu Falls have to be seen to be appreciated as mere words cannot do them justice. They truly live up to their name, which translates as �big water:� They�re the world�s largest waterfalls system, with 275 waterfalls of various sizes � Devil�s Throat is the biggest. For much of its journey to the ocean, the Iguazu River flows through Brazil, but, seemingly in a spirit of international cooperation, most of the falls are in Argentina.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="http://cdn.touropia.com/gfx/b/2016/03/rio_de_janeiro.jpg">
<br>
<p align="center">When you visit Rio de Janeiro you simply must take a samba lesson; even The Girl from Ipanema does the samba, Rio�s most popular dance. Besides the samba, this cosmopolitan city is known for its Carnival, the bossa nova, and Copacabana Beach. Its most famous landmark may be the Christ the Redeemer statue that sits atop Corcovado Mountain. Rio hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics, though its residents overwhelmingly prefer soccer: Maracana Stadium is one of the largest soccer stadiums in the world.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="http://cdn.touropia.com/gfx/b/2016/03/machu_picchu.jpg">
<br>
<p align="center">Machu Picchu is a magnificent representation of the Inca civilization before the Spanish came. Nestled in the Peruvian Andes, Machu Picchu served as a palace for the emperor, a fortress and as a site for religious ceremonies where human sacrifices were made to appease the gods. Untouched by the Spanish, the site was abandoned after the conquest, only to be �discovered� by an American professor in the early 1900s. Built from polished stones, Machu Picchu is a fascinating example of classical Inca architecture. With its spectacular views, Machu Picchu is Peru�s most visited tourist attraction.</p>
